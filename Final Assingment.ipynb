Introduction\n### 1.1 Business Problem Description\nSantiago de Chile is the largest city in Santiago, concentrating over 7 million people in a country which total population is 17.5 million, comprising more than 40% of Chile's total population in one city.  This city is divided into 37 counties/districts located in an area of 837.89 squared kilometers(source)(s2). This creates huge differences in density for each district translating into a critical decision for a new business on where to focus their efforts to start with. \nAs an entrepreneur the idea of creating a new business in this city could cause big headaches as to where should it be located and what should be the target market. \nThis report will be guided by the following questions:\n\t1. What is the best district in the city of Santiago, Chile for a new business?  \n\t2. What should be the focus of this new business to thrive in that county?\n\t3. Can that business expand to other districts?\nWe will leverage the results of the Chilean National Institute of Statistics regarding population by district, correlating it to their geographical placement and the venue density, and type in each district via the Foursquare API.\n\n### 1.2 Data Description\nThe following information sources will be considered for this project.\n\t\u2022 Venue Information\n\t\t\u25cb Forsquare API\u00a0to retrieve every venue located in the city of Santiago.\n\t\u2022 Demographics\n\t\t\u25cb Information is being leveraged from the INE (National Institute of Statistics) regarding the population of all the districts.\n\t\u2022 Geographical information\n\t\t\u25cb I researched for the location of all the districts in Santiago.\n",
